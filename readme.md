> ESLint [shareable config](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs.html) for the most sweet-ass vanilla JavaScript. ü§ôüèº

## Installation

```console
yarn add eslint-config-sweet eslint typescript --dev
```

## Usage

As soon as you've installed the config, you can extend from it. To do that, find your [config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files) and add the following line:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: "sweet"
};
```

## How will my code look when using this?

Sweet, man. That's the point. On a more serious note though: It mostly, of course, enforces consistency, even though it may not look like it the first few moments. It will make your code feel more lightweight and nudge you towards using more modern APIs and good practices, while maintaining readability and keeping complexity down.

## Nice to know

This config doesn't give flying damn about your indentation. If you want to enforce a certain style, which I strongly recommend, you can either go ahead and add your desired [`indent`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent) rule to your config or do what I do: use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). It's sole purpose is this kind of stuff.
